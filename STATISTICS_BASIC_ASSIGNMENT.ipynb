        "\n",
        "Z-score normalization (also known as standardization) is a data scaling technique where values are standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. The resulting values, called Z-scores, represent how many standard deviations away a data point is from the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Significance:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Standard Scale:** It transforms data to a standard scale with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This makes it easier to compare data points from different datasets that may have different units or scales.\n",
        "2.  **Identifying Outliers:** Data points with Z-scores significantly far from 0 (e.g., typically beyond +2 or -2, depending on the context) can be considered potential outliers.\n",
        "3.  **Assumptions of Algorithms:** Many machine learning algorithms and statistical methods assume that the input data is normally distributed or at least on a similar scale. Z-score normalization helps meet these assumptions, improving the performance of such algorithms.\n",
        "4.  **Feature Scaling:** In machine learning, it's a common technique for feature scaling, ensuring that no single feature dominates the model training process due to its larger scale."
